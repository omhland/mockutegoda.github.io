###TODOIST
Todoist serves as a tool for pushing tasks between teammembers. This allows us to avoid direct prompting and the resulting break of consentration. In the graph bellow, Tomas needs Ole to perform a task. He register the task in Todoist. This allows Ole to work through his task without interuption.

A disclaimer - I lack precise words to accurately describe business activities (never had a serious job). Feel free to adjust them.

A workspace StartUp has projects within it. We track the time for each project. Tags and descriptions can be used when tracking. These are the projects for now, more coming:
Internal Organizational Structure: any activities that assist our work and internal structure: organizing tools, apps, documents, etc. Tag examples: “creating templates”, “researching work styles” or “guidelines for re-evaluation”.
Meetings: each person tracks time for each meeting, so we see the individual and total time spent in meetings. Preparation could include creating slides or similar but research for the meeting should go under other projects, like Internal Structure or Concept Research.
Self-Education: time spent for reading and learning skills. For example, I tracked time for self-education with the tag “reading” and a description “Lean Startup”.
Administration: practicalities, basic tasks that need to be done. Tag example: “sorting out living situation”
Concept Research: time spent researching concepts and ideas.
External Communications: time spent on reaching out and talking to outside people for any purposes (learning, practical, financial or any other). Tag example: “talking to Mantas Pajarskas about Google’s internal structure” or “talking to Cal Newport about our workflow”
